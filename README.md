uptime-db-maintenance-scripts
=============================

This repo contains all the trim and profile scripts for the different back end databases uptime supports. They are broken down into each version of uptime as well as database type. 
The Profile scripts can be run to determine how much data is there and the trim script can be run to clean up the old data.
